# OPENCHEAT
This project is an opensource cheat platform for videogames.  
The idea is that instead of downloading trainers from dodgy websites you can just share a JSON config and import it into this platform.  
This should:
- save time if you want to publish your cheats so you don't have to package and distribute a trainer
- avoid viruses/adaware/miners to the end user
- teach you how a trainer works

## Installation
Place the exe in a folder next to the cheats and user_prefs folder.  
Run the exe and the UI should be pretty intuitive

## To create cheats
Just find the right memory location using [cheat engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/) and place a json in the cheats folder using the already existing ones as a template.  
You can open me a PR afterward.
Depending on the success of the platform I might improve this in the future.
